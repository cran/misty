\description{
This function conducts dominance analysis (Budescu, 1993; Azen & Budescu, 2003)
for linear models estimated by using the \code{lm()} function to determine the
relative importance of predictor variables. By default, the function reports
general dominance, but conditional and complete dominance can be requested by
specifying the argument \code{print}.

\details{
Dominance analysis (Budescu, 1993; Azen & Budescu, 2003) is used to determine
the relative importance of predictor variables in a statistical model by examining
the additional contribution of predictors in \emph{R}-squared relative to each
other in all of the possible \eqn{2^{(p - 2)}} subset models with \eqn{p} being
the number of predictors. Three levels of dominance can be established through
pairwise comparison of all predictors in a regression model:
\describe{
\item{\strong{Complete Dominance}}{A predictor completely dominates another
predictor if its additional contribution in \emph{R}-Squared is higher than that
of the other predictor across all possible subset models that do not include both
predictors. For example, in a regression model with four predictors, \eqn{X_1}
completely dominates \eqn{X_2} if the additional contribution in \emph{R}-squared
for \eqn{X_1} is higher compared to \eqn{X_2} in (1) the null model without any
predictors, (2) the model including \eqn{X_3}, (3) the model including
\eqn{X_4}, and (4) the model including both \eqn{X_3} and \eqn{X_4}. Note
that complete dominance cannot be established if one predictor's additional
contribution is greater than the other's for some, but not all of the subset
models. In this case, dominance is undetermined and the result will be \code{NA}}
\item{\strong{Conditional Dominance}}{A predictor conditionally dominates another
predictor if its average additional contribution in \emph{R}-squared is higher
within each model size than that of the other predictor. For example, in a
regression model with four predictors, \eqn{X_1} conditionally dominates \eqn{X_2}
if the average additional contribution in \emph{R}-squared is higher compared
to \eqn{X_2} in (1) the null model without any predictors, (2) the four models
including one predictor, (3) the six models including two predictors, and (4)
the four models including three predictors.}
\item{\strong{General Dominance}}{A predictor generally dominates another predictor
if its overall averaged additional contribution in \emph{R}-squared is higher
than that of the other predictor. For example, in a regression model with four
predictors, \eqn{X_1} generally dominates \eqn{X_2} if the average across the
four conditional values (i.e., null model, model with one predictor, model with
two predictors, and model with three predictors) is higher than that of \eqn{X_2}.
Note that the general dominance measures represent the proportional contribution
that each predictor makes to the \emph{R}-squared since their sum across all
predictors equals the  \emph{R}-squared of the full model.}
}
The three levels of dominance are related to each other in a hierarchical fashion:
Complete dominance implies conditional dominance, which in turn implies general
dominance. However, the converse may not hold for more than three predictors.
That is, general dominance does not imply conditional dominance, and conditional
dominance does not necessarily imply complete dominance.
